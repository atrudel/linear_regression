# Linear regression

This is an implementation of a univariate linear regression algorithm that uses
gradient descent.

The dataset that is used describes the price of cars according to their mileage.

Two programs are implemented:
  - estimate.py:  promts the user to enter a mileage and outputs a prediction
  - train.py:    trains and saves the linear regression model

Both programs have data visualization options
